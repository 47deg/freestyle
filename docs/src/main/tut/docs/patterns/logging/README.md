## Logging

The `Logging` effect algebra is part of the `freestyle-logging` module, and it allows purely functional logging in the monadic computation flow of a Freestyle program.
It includes most of the well-known operations found in loggers as well as different levels to achieve the desired logging output.

In order to enable this integration, you can depend on _freestyle-logging_:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.47deg" %% "freestyle-logging" % "0.1.0"
```

### Operations

The set of abstract operations of the [`Logging` algebra](../../../../../../../freestyle-logging/shared/src/main/scala/logging.scala) are specified as follows:

```scala
@free trait LoggingM {
  def debug(msg: String): FS[Unit]
  def debugWithCause(msg: String, cause: Throwable): FS[Unit]
  def error(msg: String): FS[Unit]
  def errorWithCause(msg: String, cause: Throwable): FS[Unit]
  def info(msg: String): FS[Unit]
  def infoWithCause(msg: String, cause: Throwable): FS[Unit]
  def warn(msg: String): FS[Unit]
  def warnWithCause(msg: String, cause: Throwable): FS[Unit]
}
```

Each operation corresponds to a variations of the typical operations `debug`, `error`, `info`, or `warn`, which cover most use cases when performing logging in an application.

The _freestyle-logging_ module contains built-in handlers, both for Scala.jvm and for Scala.js, which you can use out of the box.
The [JVM handler](../../../../../../../freestyle-logging/jvm/src/main/scala/loggingJVM.scala) is based on the [Verizon's Journal Library](https://github.com/Verizon/journal).
The [JS handler](../../../../../../../freestyle-logging/js/src/main/scala/loggingJS.scala) is based on the [slogging](https://github.com/jokade/slogging) library.

### Example

In the following example, we will show how easy it is to add the logging algebra and use it in a pure program.

Before we do anything else, we need to add the usual set of imports from Freestyle and Cats to create our algebras:

```tut:silent
import freestyle._
import freestyle.implicits._
```

We will use a simple algebra, whose code is available [here](../../../../scala/logging.scala), 
along with a stub handler that returns a list of customer Id's for illustration purposes.

```scala
@free trait CustomerService {
  def customers: FS[List[String]]
}
```
```tut:silent
import freestyle.docs.patterns.CustomerService
```

At this point, we may aggregate our customer algebra with any other algebras in a _@module_ which will automatically compose monadic actions
derived from using different algebras:

```tut:book
import freestyle.logging._
import freestyle.loggingJVM.implicits._

@module trait App[F[_]] {
  val customerService: CustomerService[F]
  val log: LoggingM[F]
}
```

And finally, we can create a program and compose our logging algebra in the same monadic comprehension along with our customer service:

```tut:book
def program[F[_]](implicit app : App[F]): FreeS[F, Unit] =
  for {
    customers <- app.customerService.customers
	_ <- app.log.debug(s"found customers: $customers")
  } yield ()
```

Once we have a program, we can interpret it to our desired runtime. In this case, we want to use `scala.util.Try` as our runtime. 
For this, we need to  implement a handler `CustomerService.Handler[Try]`, to specify how to interpret our algebra into `Try`. 

```tut:book
import scala.util.Try

implicit val customerServiceHandler: CustomerService.Handler[Try] =
  new CustomerService.Handler[Try] {
    def customers: Try[List[String]] = Try(List("John", "Jane", "Luis"))
  }
```

Finally, to interpret the whole program, we also need an instance of `cats.Monad[Try]`, so we will use the one that `cats` provides. 

```tut:evaluated
import cats.instances.try_._

program[App.Op].exec[Try]
```

### Alternative logging with the `WriterM` effect

The same semantics achieved by the backed in logging algebra can be achieved with traditional MTL style effects that impose a `MonadWriter` constraint in the program's
target monad. Learn more about the writer effect in the [Effects](../../effects/writer) section.

### A note on performance

Using pure functional logging is ideal, but it can affect performance in an applicationâ€™s hot paths because Free algebras are reified in memory, then interpreted. While this is a non-issue in most applications whose bottleneck are IO/Network bound, you should be aware that traditional logging placed in handlers may yield better overall performance in specific cases.
